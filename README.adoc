|If you use a directive/component in a template, you should define this one as a dependency for the component, thanks to the directives property of the @Component decorator.

|Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
|You possibly imported a file with its `.ts` extension, leading to it not being loaded during runtime and being replaced by your `index.html`, causing the syntax error.
